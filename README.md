# Razor: An Ultima Online Assistant

## UO:R Community Edition

The purpose of this fork of Razor is continue development on Razor that focuses on "quality of life" improvements to Razor while keeping the spirit of Razor intact.

This version is tagged the **UO:R Community Edition** simply due to the fact that most of the feedback, ideas and testing as come from the **[UO Renaissance](http://www.uorenaissance.com/)** community.  I am not associated with the staff or administration of this shard, I am simply a player and a fan of the UO era this shard represents.

This version of Razor is based off of 1.0.13.13 (well technically 1.4.0.3, but the differences between them are based on the .NET version they were upgraded to).

**TL;DR:** If you use Razor today, regardless of the Ultima Online server you play on, this version should also work.
